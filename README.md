# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction (Supervised ML Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts a student's final exam score using multiple academic and behavioral features.  
It is a basic supervised machine learning regression project built using Linear Regression.

The goal is to understand:

- Feature Engineering
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Overfitting Detection
- Train-Test Split
- Performance Metrics

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Can we predict a student's final score based on:

- Daily Study Hours
- Sleep Hours
- Attendance Percentage
- Previous Score
- Homework Completion Rate
- Screen Time Hours
